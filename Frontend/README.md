To build the navigation structure of this application, I started by configuring the routes. This involved using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components from the react-router-dom library. The first step was to ensure the availability of react-router-dom in the project, which I did by executing: <code>npm install react-router-dom --save</code>

**<h3>Understanding BrowserRouter</h3>**
In App.js, I utilized BrowserRouter as the foundational component for enabling routing. This component plays a crucial role in the application:

**HTML5 History API Integration:** BrowserRouter leverages the HTML5 history API, ensuring that the user interface remains in sync with the URL.
**URL Structure:** It facilitates a clean and user-friendly URL structure, vital for both user experience and SEO.
**Root Level Placement:** It's placed at the root of the application's component tree, enabling routing capabilities across the entire application.

**<h3>Implementing Routes and Route</h3>**
Within BrowserRouter, Routes and Route are pivotal for path configuration and component mapping.

**Routes**
Functionality: Routes (formerly known as Switch in older versions) is responsible for rendering the first Route or Redirect child that matches the current location.
Use Case: It's particularly useful for grouping several route configurations and selecting the appropriate one based on the URL path.
Route
Path-Component Mapping: Each Route defines a correlation between a URL path and a component in the application.
Rendering Logic: It decides which component to render based on the current path in the URL.
Flexibility: You can define multiple Route elements within Routes to cater to different view components for different paths.
